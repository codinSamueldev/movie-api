# Key Notes

I am storing most valuables commands, insights, notes and things to keep in mind when using FastAPI.

## Commands
Best practices when installing any framework/library in Python, we must create and activate a virtual environment.
In order to create and activate virtual environments, check this out:
Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv virtualEnvironmentName
```
For **MacOS** and **Linux** users, activate the virtual environment with the following command
```bash
source virtualEnvironmentName/bin/activate
```
For **Windows** users, activate the virtual environment with the following command
```bash
virtualEnvironmentName/Scripts/activate
```

> "Great! Now that the virtual environment is activated, we can install *FastAPI* and *uvicorn*."

FastAPI installation
```bash
pip install fastapi
```
Then, uvicorn installation
```bash
pip install uvicorn
```
